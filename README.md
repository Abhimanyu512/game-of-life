#GAME OF LIFE
The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state<br>
requiring no further input. A person interacts with the game of life by creating an initial<br> configuration and seeing how it evolves. The rules for the configuration are as follows:<br>
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.<br>
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.<br>
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.<br>
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.<br>
